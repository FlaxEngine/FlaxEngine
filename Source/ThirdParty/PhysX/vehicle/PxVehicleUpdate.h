	\note Blocking hits (PxQueryHitType::eBLOCK) and non-blocking hits (PxQueryHitType::TOUCH) are supported.  If the pre-and post-filter functions of the PxBatchQuery 
	instance are set up to return blocking hits it is recommended to set nbHitsPerQuery = 1.  If the filter functions returns touch hits then it is recommended to 
	set nbHitsPerQuery > 1.  The exact value depends on the expected complexity of the geometry that lies under the wheel.  For complex geometry, especially with dynamic 
	objects, it is recommended to use non-blocking hits.  The vehicle update function will analyze all returned hits and choose the most appropriate using the thresholds 
	set in PxVehicleSetSweepHitRejectionAngles.
