/**
\brief Prototype of shader function that is used to compute wheel torque and tire forces.
\param[in]  shaderData is the shader data for the tire being processed.  The shader data describes the tire data in the format required by the tire model that is implemented by the shader function.
\param[in]  tireFriction is the value of friction for the contact between the tire and the ground.
\param[in]  longSlip is the value of longitudinal slip experienced by the tire.
\param[in]  latSlip is the value of lateral slip experienced by the tire.
\param[in]  camber is the camber angle of the tire in radians.
\param[in]  wheelOmega is the rotational speed of the wheel.
\param[in]  wheelRadius is the distance from the tire surface to the center of the wheel.
\param[in]  recipWheelRadius is the reciprocal of wheelRadius.
\param[in]  restTireLoad is the load force experienced by the tire when the vehicle is at rest.
\param[in]  normalisedTireLoad is a pre-computed value equal to the load force on the tire divided by restTireLoad.
\param[in]  tireLoad is the load force currently experienced by the tire (= restTireLoad*normalisedTireLoad)
\param[in]  gravity is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration.
\param[in]  recipGravity is the reciprocal of the magnitude of gravitational acceleration.
\param[out] wheelTorque is the torque that is to be applied to the wheel around the wheel's axle.
\param[out] tireLongForceMag is the magnitude of the longitudinal tire force to be applied to the vehicle's rigid body.
\param[out] tireLatForceMag is the magnitude of the lateral tire force to be applied to the vehicle's rigid body.
\param[out] tireAlignMoment is the aligning moment of the tire that is to be applied to the vehicle's rigid body (not currently used).
