\brief The control inputs for a PxVehicleDriveTank.

\note The values of eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_LEFT and eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_RIGHT determine how much 
of the total available drive torque is diverted to the left and right wheels.  These entries in the 
enumerated list represent the state of the left and right control sticks of a tank. The total available 
drive torque available is controlled by eANALOG_INPUT_ACCEL, which represents the state of the acceleration
pedal and controls how much torque will be applied to the engine.  

\note To accelerate forwards eANALOG_INPUT_ACCEL must be greater than zero so that torque is applied to drive the 
engine, while eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_LEFT and eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_RIGHT must also be greater than zero
to divert the available drive torque to the left and wheels. If eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_LEFT > eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_RIGHT
the tank will turn to the right.  If eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_RIGHT > eANALOG_INPUT_THRUST_LEFT
the tank will turn to the left.

\brief Two driving models are supported.

\note If eSTANDARD is chosen the left and right wheels are always driven in the same direction.  If the tank is in 
a forward gear the left and right wheels will all be driven forwards, while in reverse gear the left and right wheels
will all be driven backwards. With eSTANDARD the legal range of left and right thrust is (0,1).

\note If eSPECIAL is chosen it is possible to drive the left and right wheels in different directions. 
With eSPECIAL the legal range of left and right thrust is (-1,1).  In forward(reverse) gear negative thrust values drive the wheels 
backwards(forwards), while positive thrust values drives the wheels forwards(backwards).  

\note A sharp left turn can be achieved in eSTANDARD mode by braking with the left wheels and thrusting forward with the 
right wheels. A smaller turning circle can theoretically be achieved in eSPECIAL mode by applying negative thrust to the left wheels and positive
thrust to the right wheels.

\note In both modes the legal ranges of acceleration and left/right brake are all (0,1).
