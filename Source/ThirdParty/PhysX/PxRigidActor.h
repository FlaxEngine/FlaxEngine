	\brief Method for setting an actor's pose in the world.

	This method instantaneously changes the actor space to world space transformation.

	This method is mainly for dynamic rigid bodies (see #PxRigidDynamic). Calling this method on static actors is
	likely to result in a performance penalty, since internal optimization structures for static actors may need to be
	recomputed. In addition, moving static actors will not interact correctly with dynamic actors or joints.

	To directly control an actor's position and have it correctly interact with dynamic bodies and joints, create a dynamic
	body with the PxRigidBodyFlag::eKINEMATIC flag, then use the setKinematicTarget() commands to define its path.

	Even when moving dynamic actors, exercise restraint in making use of this method. Where possible, avoid:

	\li moving actors into other actors, thus causing overlap (an invalid physical state)

	\li moving an actor that is connected by a joint to another away from the other (thus causing joint error)
