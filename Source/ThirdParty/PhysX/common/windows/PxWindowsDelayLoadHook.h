 	\brief PxDelayLoadHook

	This is a helper class for delay loading the PhysXCommon dll and PhysXFoundation dll. 
	If a PhysXCommon dll or PhysXFoundation dll with a non-default file name needs to be loaded, 
	PxDelayLoadHook can be sub-classed to provide the custom filenames.

	Once the names are set, the instance must be set for use by PhysX.dll using PxSetPhysXDelayLoadHook(), 
	PhysXCooking.dll using PxSetPhysXCookingDelayLoadHook()	or by PhysXCommon.dll using PxSetPhysXCommonDelayLoadHook().
