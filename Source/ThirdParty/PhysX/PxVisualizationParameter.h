		\brief This overall visualization scale gets multiplied with the individual scales. Setting to zero ignores all visualizations. Default is 0.

		The below settings permit the debug visualization of various simulation properties. 
		The setting is either zero, in which case the property is not drawn. Otherwise it is a scaling factor
		that determines the size of the visualization widgets.

		Only objects for which visualization is turned on using setFlag(eVISUALIZATION) are visualized (see #PxActorFlag::eVISUALIZATION, #PxShapeFlag::eVISUALIZATION, ...).
		Contacts are visualized if they involve a body which is being visualized.
		Default is 0.

		Notes:
		- to see any visualization, you have to set PxVisualizationParameter::eSCALE to nonzero first.
		- the scale factor has been introduced because it's difficult (if not impossible) to come up with a
		good scale for 3D vectors. Normals are normalized and their length is always 1. But it doesn't mean
		we should render a line of length 1. Depending on your objects/scene, this might be completely invisible
		or extremely huge. That's why the scale factor is here, to let you tune the length until it's ok in
		your scene.
		- however, things like collision shapes aren't ambiguous. They are clearly defined for example by the
		triangles & polygons themselves, and there's no point in scaling that. So the visualization widgets
		are only scaled when it makes sense.
