\brief Binary converter for serialized streams.

\deprecated Binary conversion and binary meta data are deprecated.

The binary converter class is targeted at converting binary streams from authoring platforms, 
such as windows, osx or linux to any game runtime platform supported by PhysX. Particularly 
it is currently not supported to run the converter on a platforms that has an endian mismatch 
with the platform corresponding to the source binary file and source meta data. 

If you want to use multiple threads for batch conversions, please create one instance
of this class for each thread.
