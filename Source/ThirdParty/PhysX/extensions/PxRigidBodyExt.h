	\brief Computation of mass properties for a rigid body actor

	To simulate a dynamic rigid actor, the SDK needs a mass and an inertia tensor. 

	This method offers functionality to compute the necessary mass and inertia properties based on the shapes declared in
	the PxRigidBody descriptor and some additionally specified parameters. For each shape, the shape geometry, 
	the shape positioning within the actor and the specified shape density are used to compute the body's mass and 
	inertia properties.

	<ul>
	<li>Shapes without PxShapeFlag::eSIMULATION_SHAPE set are ignored unless includeNonSimShapes is true.</li>
	<li>Shapes with plane, triangle mesh or heightfield geometry and PxShapeFlag::eSIMULATION_SHAPE set are not allowed for PxRigidBody collision.</li>
	</ul>

	This method will set the mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor 

	if no collision shapes are found, the inertia tensor is set to (1,1,1) and the mass to 1

	if massLocalPose is non-NULL, the rigid body's center of mass parameter  will be set 
	to the user provided value (massLocalPose) and the inertia tensor will be resolved at that point.

	\note If all shapes of the actor have the same density then the overloaded method updateMassAndInertia() with a single density parameter can be used instead.

	\param[in,out] body The rigid body.
	\param[in] shapeDensities The per shape densities. There must be one entry for each shape which has the PxShapeFlag::eSIMULATION_SHAPE set (or for all shapes if includeNonSimShapes is set to true). Other shapes are ignored. The density values must be greater than 0.
	\param[in] shapeDensityCount The number of provided density values.
	\param[in] massLocalPose The center of mass relative to the actor frame.  If set to null then (0,0,0) is assumed.
	\param[in] includeNonSimShapes True if all kind of shapes (PxShapeFlag::eSCENE_QUERY_SHAPE, PxShapeFlag::eTRIGGER_SHAPE) should be taken into account.
