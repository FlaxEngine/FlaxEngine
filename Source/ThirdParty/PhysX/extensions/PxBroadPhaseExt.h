	/**
	\brief Creates regions for PxSceneDesc, from a global box.

	This helper simply subdivides the given global box into a 2D grid of smaller boxes. Each one of those smaller boxes
	is a region of interest for the broadphase. There are nbSubdiv*nbSubdiv regions in the 2D grid. The function does not
	subdivide along the given up axis.

	This is the simplest setup one can use with PxBroadPhaseType::eMBP. A more sophisticated setup would try to cover
	the game world with a non-uniform set of regions (i.e. not just a grid).

	\param[out]	regions			Regions computed from the input global box
	\param[in]	globalBounds	World-space box covering the game world
	\param[in]	nbSubdiv		Grid subdivision level. The function will create nbSubdiv*nbSubdiv regions.
	\param[in]	upAxis			Up axis (0 for X, 1 for Y, 2 for Z).
	\return		number of regions written out to the 'regions' array

	@see PxSceneDesc PxBroadPhaseType
