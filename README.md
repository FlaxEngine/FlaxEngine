Flax Engine is a high quality modern 3D game engine written in C++ and C#.
From stunning graphics to powerful scripts, it's designed for fast workflow with many ready-to-use features waiting for you right now. To learn more see the website ([www.flaxengine.com](https://flaxengine.com)).

This repository contains full source code of the Flax Engine (excluding NDA-protected platforms support). Anyone is welcome to contribute or use the modified source in Flax-based games.

# Getting started

Follow the instructions below to compile and run the engine from source.

## Windows

* Install Visual Studio 2022 or newer
* Install Windows 8.1 SDK or newer (via Visual Studio Installer)
* Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 v140 toolset or newer (via Visual Studio Installer)
* Install .NET 8 SDK for **Windows x64** (via Visual Studio Installer or [from web](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0))
* Install Git with LFS
* Clone repo (with LFS)
* Run **GenerateProjectFiles.bat**
* Open `Flax.sln` and set solution configuration to **Editor.Development** and solution platform to **Win64**
* Set Flax (C++) or FlaxEngine (C#) as startup project
* Compile Flax project (hit F7 or CTRL+Shift+B)
* Optionally set Debug Type to **Managed Only (.NET Core)** to debug C#-only, or **Mixed (.NET Core)** to debug both C++ and C#
* Run Flax (hit F5 key)

## Linux

* Install Visual Studio Code
* Install .NET 8 SDK ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0))
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0`
* Install Vulkan SDK ([https://vulkan.lunarg.com/](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/))
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install vulkan-sdk`
  * Arch: `sudo pacman -S spirv-tools vulkan-headers vulkan-tools vulkan-validation-layers`
* Install Git with LFS
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git git-lfs`
  * Arch: `sudo pacman -S git git-lfs`
  * `git-lfs install`
* Install the required packages:
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev zlib1g-dev`
  * Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel libx11 libxcursor libxinerama zlib`
* Install Clang compiler (version 6 or later):
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install clang lldb lld`
  * Arch: `sudo pacman -S clang lldb lld`
* Clone the repository (with LFS)
* Run `./GenerateProjectFiles.sh`
* Open workspace with Visual Code
* Build and run (configuration and task named `Flax|Editor.Linux.Development|x64`)

## Mac

* Install XCode
* Install .NET 8 SDK ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0))
* Install Vulkan SDK ([https://vulkan.lunarg.com/](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/))
* Clone repo (with LFS)
* Run `GenerateProjectFiles.command`
* Open workspace with XCode or Visual Studio Code
* Build and run (configuration  `Editor.Mac.Development`)

#### Troubleshooting

* `Could not execute because the specified command or file was not found.`

Restart PC - ensure DotNet is added to PATH for command line tools execution.

* `Microsoft.NET.TargetFrameworkInference.targets(141,5): error NETSDK1045: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 8.0.  Either target .NET 5.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET 8.0`

Use Visual Studio 2022, older versions are not supported by .NET SDK 8.

* `Building for Windows without Vulkan rendering backend (Vulkan SDK is missing)`

Install the Vulkan SDK then set an environment variable to provide the path to the SDK prior to running GenerateProjectFiles.bat: `set VULKAN_SDK=%sdk_path%`.

* `The NuGetSdkResolver did not resolve this SDK`

Install `.NET SDK`, `NuGet package manager` and `NuGet targets and build tasks` in Visual Studio components.
