# Getting started

Follow the instructions below to compile and run the engine from source.

## Flax plugin for Visual Studio

Flax Visual Studio extension provides better programming workflow, C# scripts debugging functionality and allows to attach to running engine instance to debug C# source. This extension is available to download [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flax.FlaxVS).

## Windows

* Install Visual Studio 2015 or newer
* Install Windows 8.1 SDK or newer
* Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 v140 toolset or newer
* Clone repo (with LFS)
* Run **GenerateProjectFiles.bat**
* Open `Flax.sln` and set solution configuration to **Editor.Development** and solution platform to **Win64**
* Set Flax (C++) or FlaxEngine (C#) as startup project
* Compile Flax project (hit F7 or CTRL+Shift+B)
* Run Flax (hit F5 key)

---

**Note**

If building on Windows to support Vulkan rendering, first install the Vulkan SDK then  set an environment variable to provide the path to the SDK prior to running GenerateProjectFiles.bat:

    set VULKAN_SDK=C:\VulkanSDK\version\

---

## Linux

* Install Visual Studio Code
* Install Mono ([https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable))
* Install Git with LFS
* Install requried packages: `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev nuget autoconf libogg-dev automake build-essential gettext cmake python libtool libtool-bin libpulse-dev libasound2-dev libjack-dev portaudio19-dev`
* Install compiler `sudo apt-get install clang lldb lld` (Clang 6 or newer)
* Clone repo (with LFS)
* Run `./GenerateProjectFiles.sh`
* Open workspace with Visual Code
* Build and run (configuration and task named `Flax|Editor.Linux.Development|x64`)
